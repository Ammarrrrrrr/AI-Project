## üöÄ What is the N-Queens Problem?
The N-Queens problem is a classic chess puzzle: **Place N queens on an N√óN chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.** That means no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## ü§ñ How the AI Works (Multi-core Power!)
- The AI solver splits the problem across all available CPU cores using Python's `ProcessPoolExecutor`.
- Each process solves for a different starting queen position, then results are combined for maximum speed.
- The UI remains responsive, and you get all solutions as fast as your computer allows!

---

## üé® Customization
- **Board Colors:** Click "Change Board Colors" to pick your favorite light/dark square colors.
- **Animal Icons:** Choose between cat, fox, or dog for your queen.
- **Board Size:** Try different N values for new challenges.

## üõü Troubleshooting & FAQ
**Q: The app is slow or freezes on very large boards!**
- A: Solving N-Queens for large N (e.g., 16+) is computationally intensive. The AI uses all your CPU cores, but some sizes may still take time.

**Q: I get a pickling error or multiprocessing error!**
- A: Make sure you're using Python 3.7+ and that all multiprocessing helper functions are defined at the top level of the file.

**Q: The UI looks weird or some widgets are too light!**
- A: Make sure you're using the latest PyQt5 and that your OS theme isn't interfering. All widgets are styled for dark mode.

**Q: I don't hear any sounds!**
- A: Ensure your system audio is on and the required sound files are present in the `assets/` folder.

**Q: Can I add my own animal icons or sounds?**
- A: Yes! Add your PNGs or WAVs to the `assets/` folder and update the code to use them.
